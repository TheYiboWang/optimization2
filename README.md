# optimization2
Part 1: 
Implement and test the conjugate-gradient method of optimization for multi-variable unconstrained optimization problems. 
Test on two multivariable unconstrained optimization problems, of dimensions at least 2 and 10. 

Part 2:
Compare the performance of your CG numerically (as above) to some other method such as coordinate descent or steepest descent.
